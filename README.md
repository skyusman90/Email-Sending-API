# Simple Email Sending API

It is a simple API for sending Emails. Put the SMTP Server and port number in the required EmailSenderService file and also put the required email and password assigned to you by the SMTP Server and the email you want other emails to be sent from. You can also change the subject and message in the Controller as it is hard coded there.
